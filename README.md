# crawlcrawl

A headless (all actions are done in the background without opening a browser) webcrawler that crawls a specific website after asking user to input a website name. 

It then saves a copy of the source code and when repeated it compares the two versions and produces a copy with the differences. 

A very good way to track the code for a certain website. 

I have added notes for what needs to be updated in the code file. 

PS: There are options to 

- Take a screenshot at any point for debugging. 
- Add more waiting time before opening pages. 
- Add a wait until a page loads fully before any action.
