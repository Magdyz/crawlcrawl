# crawlcrawl

A Webcrawler that crawls a specific website after asking user to input a website name. 

It then saves a copy of the source code and when repeated it compares the two versions and produces a copy with the differences. 

A very good way to track the code for a certain website. 

I have added notes for what needs to be updated in the code file.
